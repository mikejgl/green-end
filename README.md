Mike Lyth's first repository Dec 16
I have been talking to computers via a keyboard since 1974. The first I talked to filled a complete floor of a tall block in Hendon Technical College. It had a total memory of 64K -- that's right, 64 kilobytes! These days I produce and manage websites for my local church, village hall and the Whitby deanery. I live in a hamlet on the North Yorkshire Moors, England.
